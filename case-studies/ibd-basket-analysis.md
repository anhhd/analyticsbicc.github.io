## Challenge 

  As part of its overall digitalization efforts, VPBank is focused on migrating more and more customers from traditional channels to 
  digital channels for transactions and even acquisition. 
  This will result in an enhanced customer experience as well as lower operational cost for the bank. However, 
  with only 11% of customers registered for internet banking channel, the task is going to be mammoth. 
  The challenge is to identify the most suitable customers for migration who can be targeted first.
  
## Methodology

  In order to find the potential customers for cross selling i2b, BICC analyzed the product holding data of all customers who hold at least one retail or SME product. 
  To identify the potential customers, BICC then used **basket analysis** which is
  a mathematical model to explore behavior of customers and is based on the theory that if a customer buys a certain group of items, he/she is likely to buy another group of items.
  
## Results and Recommendations

The basket analysis revealed most **potential scenarios** of customer product holding which will lead to a customer buying internet banking product. 
Based on these scenarios, BICC recommended to target **more than 30K and almost 4K customers** from retail and SME respectively. 
In addition to this, BICC also recommended the product teams to create **product bundles** for **future acquisition** based on these scenarios. 

## Implementation and Business Impact

### Implementation

  The  customer list generated was shared with the respective business divisions (DBS BD/marketing depa	rtments for retail customers and SME BD/marketing departments for SME customers) for designing and executing initiatives in order to convert targeted customers to i2b channel.
  
  For example, DBS division launched email/direct marketing campaign for retail customers with the following breakup:
  
* Full list (more than **30K customers** in total) was sent to CSRs for directly converting through calls or meetings 

* More than **4K customers** (out of 34,880) based on scenario no. 5 (customers having a combination of time deposit and credit card) were targeted for an email campaign

### Business Impact

BICC estimate the TOI impact after converting all potential retail and SME customers is: **52 Billion VND per year**. 
As of 20 Sep, 2016, a total of almost **1,300 retail** and SME customers have been converted to i2b already (**3% conversion rate - 3 times** higher than normal), 
bringing in 1.5 Billion VND of total TOI impact.
