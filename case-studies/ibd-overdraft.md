# Business Problem 

Unsecured overdraft product is not a new product but recently was revamped as one of the bank's purely online products. 
Despite enticing terms and functionalities, the registration funnel for the product remains lacking, with the conversion rate for customers 
from the stage of being Pre-approved to actual registration being only 5% by early 2017.

The Analytics team is interested to understand our current customers in terms of their usage habits 
and segment them in ways that helps us serve them better.

# Methodology 

In order to find the targeted customers for Unsecured Overdraft product, 
we analyzed current customersâ€™ behavior by segmenting them based on the findings from data exploratory analysis.
Linear regression was utilized to help explore the usage trends and the level of associated risk of our current customer base.

# Results and Recommedations

Our analysis gave light to the best time to launch marketing campaigns using insights from current customer usage habits. 
We then discovered a new customer base of offline and small-business owners who are under-served but would otherwise 
have real interest in the product and be profitable

The risk analysis also shown evidence to support a decision to relax current requirements for pre-approval.

# Implementation and Business Impact

The recommendations was provided to Digital Banking Division and is currently under review in conjuction with 
focus group surveys to improve the Unsecured Overdraft product.

The estimated TOI impact of converting all potential Unsecured Overdraft customers is at an approxiamated 4.6 Billion VND.
