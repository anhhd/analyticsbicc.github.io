## Challenge

  Since the end of 2015, SME has been concentrating on developing unsecured loan portfolio. Out of all types of unsecured loans, 
  BIL is the most profitable one. 
  However, out of all customers having SME loans, only 11% customers have BIL with 40% of them having/had at least 2 BIL contracts. 
  The challenge for SME business is to find the most potential customers for cross selling BIL 

## Methodology

In order to find the potential customers for cross selling BIL, BICC analyzed customer demographic and product holding data of SME loan customers. 
BICC then used 2 methods - **basket analysis** and **multivariate analysis** to identify the potential customers. 
**Multivariate analysis** (MVA) is based on the statistical principle of multivariate statistics, 
which involves observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time

## Results and Recommendations

After analyzing various data variables through multivariate analysis, BICC found that majority of BIL customers have the following characteristics:
  
* Vintage <= 3 years (76%)
* Belong to top 4 industries, the details already shared with SME marketing department

Based on the outcome above, BICC recommended to target more than 2K potential customers for cross selling BIL.

## Implementation and Business Impact

### Implementation

The  customer list was shared with SME BD/marketing departments for designing and executing initiatives in order to cross sell BIL. 
Before customers were targeted, 2 actions were taken by the product department in business unit:

* Product policy was revised to accommodate BIL
* Lending criteria were expanded in order to include more and more customers

### Business Impact

  BICC estimate the TOI impact after converting all potential SME customers is: **more than 90 Billion VND per year**. 
  In the end of Sep, 2016, the conversion rate from these customers is 1%, bringing in morre than **1 Billion VND** of total TOI impact.
