## Challenge

  One of the most important KPI of retail credit card team is to get multi billions VND of monthly TOI
  which can be achieved by increasing number and amount of transactions. 
  However, there is a very high percentage of card holders who face declined transactions and many of them might decrease their card usage over time or even worse, 
  close the card altogether. The challenge for retail business is to understand the loss impact of declined transactions and having actions to reduce the losses.
  

## Methodology


From data analysis, BICC defined three most important reasons for transaction decline namely: exceed daily limit, exceed overall limit, 
inactive e-commerce function. BICC calculated average daily transaction amount before and after the period of facing declined transaction and 
estimated the reduction in daily transaction amount because of the decline. Finally, BICC used profit & loss analysis to estimate total loss from declined transaction

  
## Results and Recommendations

  After analyzing, BICC found that the percentage of card holders which reduce transaction of declined group is significantly higher than non-declined group. 
  This lead to the loss of multi billions VND per month.
  
  To reduce declind transactions, BICC recommended three key actions:

* Activate the e-commerce payment function by default
* Have limit incremental policy
* Send customers SMS when they face declined transactions

## Implementation and Business Impact

### Implementation

* Activate e-commerce payment function by default: 

BICC extracted list of card holders who have never activated  e-commerce payment function. 
Credit card team worked with marketing team to send SMS to those card holders about automatically activating the function. Card holders 
had the right to cancel it by sending feedback SMS

* New limit incremental policy for card holders:

Credit card team proposed new limit incremental policy for card holders who have good repayment history. BICC helped to generate the qualified card holders list. Credit card team then worked with IT and other parties to increase overall limit of eligible card holders as well as inform to them by SMS

### Business Impact

BICC estimate the loss impact of credit card declined transactions is **more than 20 Billion VND per year**. 
As of 24 Sep, 2016, we recorded a declined rate of 16%, which is 4% less than the historical average, bringing a reduction in loss (in other words, gain) 
of 4.5 Billion VND per year.
