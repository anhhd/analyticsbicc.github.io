# Business Problem 

CASA Online is an online tool developed by the Digital Banking Services division in late 2015, enabling potential and existing VPBank customers to sign up for internet banking service. After over 1.5 years of implementation, the tool generated approximately 13% of the current internet banking customer pool, which is not up to par with the Bank's expectation.

The Analytics team would like to evaluate whether CASA Online is a worthwhile channel to focus marketing efforts into, and if so, to target the right customers for this channel.

# Methodology 

We used data exploratory analysis methods to analyze online banking customer information and their online banking behavior. We also calculated the retention rates for related customer segments.

A market basket analysis was performed to find the potential customer base for this product and the best time to convert existing offline customers.

# Results and Recommedations

Based on the quality of this channel's customers and their behavior analysis, we conclude that CASA Online is worth investing in. An important insight was found on the relationship between initial current account balance before internet banking service signup and the level of online activeness of customers. 

We also make recommendations on which customer segments to target as well as how to best approach them.

# Implementation and Business Impact

The recommendations are in tentative implementation plan to apply on upcoming CASA Online marketing and sales campaign.

The number of potential users acquired is projected to be at approximately 200,000 customers.
