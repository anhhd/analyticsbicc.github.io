## Challenge

  Retail division is implementing deep farming strategy in 2016, 
  a core plank of which is cross selling credit card and UPL to active customers. 
  Historical conversion rates of cross selling programs have been quite low with 0.66% for NPA (non-preapproved) credit card, 
  4.28% for PA (pre-approved) credit card and 1.87% for NPA UPL. 
  The challenge is to identify high potential customers who can be targeted for these two products.

## Methodology

  To find potential customers, BICC created an opportunity vs. value (TOI) matrix and defined a good target base from very high TOI or very high opportunity customers. 
  Further to this, logistic regression based cross sell models were built for credit card and UPL in order to generate cross sell leads for all sales channels. 
  **Logistic regression** is a **econometric method** that measures relationship between categorical dependent and independent variables using a logistic function.

## Results and Recommendations

  After analyzing, BICC reveals a list of thousands customers base.
  For PA cross sell programs, all good customers should be highly prioritized for contacting through all sales channels. 
  For customers who can not be converted, BICC to generate NPA leads for credit card and UPL cross sell based on the propensity scores generated through the models.
  
  From 2016, retail division has been focusing on PA programs to drive cross selling. 
  But good customers who somehow were not qualified for PA conditions were not contacted for cross selling at all. 
  By utilizing cross sell models, BICC now can extract thousands of customers for NPA programs. 
  BICC estimates the number of cross sold products will be more than 1K for both credit cards and  UPLs out of the NPA base.

## Implementation and Business Impact

### Implementation

Credit card and UPL potential NPA leads were uploaded to CRM system for branches and central farming team for cross selling.
After that, BICC worked closely with BMT department of retail division to communicate and instruct sales channels in those programs while proposing support policies 
in order to get highest conversion rates.
BICC also created reports to help track programsâ€™ performance while continuing to apply further analytics to improve the performance of regression 
models and generate new cross sell leads.

### Business Impact

BICC estimate the TOI impact after converting all potential customers is: **more than 10 Billion VND per year**. 
As of 24 Sep, 2016, the conversion rate of the program is 2%, bringing in almost 3 Billion VND of total TOI impact.
