## Challenge

  Retail division is implementing deep farming strategy in 2016, 
  a core plank of which is cross selling credit card and UPL to active customers. 
  Historical conversion rates of cross selling programs have been quite low for credit card & UPL.
  The challenge is to identify high potential customers who can be targeted for these two products.

## Methodology

  To find potential customers, BICC created an opportunity vs. value (TOI) 
  matrix and defined a good target base from very high TOI or very high opportunity customers. 
  Further to this, logistic regression based cross sell models were built for 
  credit card and UPL in order to generate cross sell leads for all sales channels. 
  Logistic regression is an econometric method that measures the 
  relationship between a categorical dependent variable and independent variables using a logistic function.
  
## Results and Recommendations

  After analyzing, BICC revealed a list of thousands of potential customers. 
  For PA cross sell programs, all good customers should be highly prioritized for contacting through 
  all sales channels. For customers who cannot be converted, 
  BICC generated NPA leads for credit card and UPL cross sell based on the 
  propensity scores generated through the models.
  
  
  
## Implementation and Business Impact

### Implementation

Credit card and UPL potential NPA leads were uploaded to CRM system 
for branches and central farming team for cross selling. 
After that, BICC worked closely with BMT department of retail division to 
communicate and instruct sales channels in those programs while proposing supporting policies in 
order to get the highest conversion rates. BICC also created reports to help track programsâ€™ performance 
while continuing to apply further analytics to improve the performance of the regression models and generate new cross sell leads.

### Business Impact

BICC estimated the TOI impact after converting all potential customers to be **more than 10 Billion VND per year**. 
As of 24 Sep, 2016, the **conversion rate of the program was 2%**, bringing in almost 3 Billion VND of total TOI impact.
