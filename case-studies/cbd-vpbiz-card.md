# Challenge 

  The VPBiz product has met with initial success, it has grown rapidly since 2015, the product had reached 2,665 companies, with a total of 8,895 VPBiz cards issused. From 2015 to the end of the data, the active company rate rose from around 50% to nearly 70%, with Platinum cardholders leading the way. 
  
  This rapid growth arises the demand to have better understand about VPBiz SME credit card. VPbiz credit card product analysis project was deployed with the cooperation between VPBank's SME BU, BICC departments and Andafin company.
  
  The data analysis project focusing on the VPBiz SME credit card customer lifecycle. Our goals were to better understand customer lifetime value (CLV), customer acquisition cost (CAC), customer engagement, and customer behavior by gender.
  
# Methodology

1. Based on the initial objective and research questions from the BU, Andafin and BICC identify and collect the data needed for the project.

2. The data collection process contains multiple loops of data collection, initial cleaning, review & checking data quality until either: the data needed for answering research questions is provided OR we can confirm that there is no data available that will help answer a research question.

3. After finalizing data collection process, the project team moves on with:

* Detailed data cleaning: Check duplicated records and mapping keys, then review and revise category variables, re-define categories to make meaningful/analyzable categories, and create additional calculations/variables that will be useful for analysis.

* Baseline analysis and double check against existing reports: Generate basic figures/graphs from the data. Ex.: whole portfolio size, customers count, cards counts, NPL ratio. Verify these figure with existing reports to ensure the accuracy of data collection and cleaning.

* Segment analysis and detailed analysis based on research questions: Re-output basic figures with segment data that may help answer research questions; pass to the project leader for review and insight generation.

* Based on the findings, decide on further analysis and proceed through several cycles until getting reasonable answers for research questions, subject to time and scope constraints.

4. Finalize the figures/reports, selecting from the hundreds of graphs generated during the project to focus on insightful figures that answer the research questions

# Results and Recommendations

  **Customer lifetime value**: We found that the CLV of the average VPBiz customer stands at 15.2 million VND, and VPBank spends an average of 900,000 VND on customer acquisition, for a customer NPV of 14.3 million VND per company. Unsecured contracts are far more valuable than secured contracts, and female-owned companies (based on the IFC definition) are somewhat more valuable than other companies, though this is in part because larger companies are more likely structured in a way that will satisfy the “female-owned” definition. Companies that use their cards in a supply chain relationship post several times the average CLV, along with higher retention.

  **Spend patterns**: We spotted distinctions between Classic and Platinum cardholders, as well as card usage patterns that divide into general purchasing and supply chain categories. Classic cards are much more likely to be used to buy electronics or furniture as well as for ATM withdrawals, whereas Platinum cardholders favor the government/education category as well as the marketing category (largely Google/Facebook ads). Supply chain users focus their spend on one or two merchants, and maintain high balances but have NPL90 ratios near zero.

  **Promotions** are designed to increase customer spending and retention at the on-boarding phase as well as later in the customer lifecycle. We found that the on-boarding promotions in effect since 2016 have a strong effect on customer retention, with around 90% of 2016-H1 customers who qualified for the promotion continuing to use the card, as compared to only 50% of customers who did not qualify. On the other hand, category cashback for existing customers has shown mixed results; we found that some quarterly promotions had an effect on spending while others did not, and we have made recommendations for adjusting the promotions in the future.

  **Gender**: We noted that women are far more likely than men to be in trading businesses, and female-owned companies are more likely to be in the manufacturing business. There are no significant differences in Classic/Platinum product usage by gender, but spend patterns vary substantially, with women more likely to spend in categories including travel, utilities, marketing/ads.

  **Repayment behavior**: We found that customers who use the product as a “charge card”, paying 100% of their balances, generate nearly as much revenue as other customers due to the interchange fees they produce; this group largely overlaps with the “supply chain” segment. At the other end of the spectrum, customers who pay an average of less than 30% of their statement balance (i.e. less than the minimum payment) generate the most revenue, but at substantial risk to the bank.

  **Recommendations**: 
We recommended several changes to the VPBiz product, including a new product aimed at supply chain customers; a points-based loyalty program; improved customer tracking including promotion registration; adjustments to quarterly spend promotions; and enhanced targeting of women-owned businesses.

  **Data usage at VPBank**: In addition to our product recommendations, we outlined a variety of findings and recommendations for VPBank to improve its data collection and analysis capabilities in the future.
